# What I learned
• Practice building several useful and interesting java classes.
• Practice thinking about complicated behaviors with strings.
• Practice reading formal java documentation and finding the most useful functions from
those lists.
• Practice working with polymoprhism
• Writing code that is explicitly polymorphic

# Phase 1 & 2
• This project is designed in three phases. The first phase is to simply implement the core
ciphers, Caesar (which you will be implementing as part of Lab 8), and EvenOdd (a cipher 2
built on reordering letters) a word replacement cipher. This can be done before we have
fully explored inheritance and polymorphism in class. The second phase is to modify these
classes to use inheritance, you should also fully debug these classes at this point. The third
and final phase is to add a SuperCipher class, and an EncryptUtils class which use the other
ciphers polymorphically, allowing powerful and customize superencipherment.
